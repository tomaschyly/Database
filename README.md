# Database

SQL and NoSQL database connector, useful when access to multiple types of systems using one syntax is needed.

The idea is to have one syntax which is then used to access data or execute others actions on various types of SQL and NoSQL based database systems. Useful when one app is used to access multiple database systems.

## Installation

Add to your application via `npm`:
```
npm install tch-database --save
```
Or use `yarn`:
```
yarn add tch-database
```
This will install `tch-database` and add it to your application's `package.json` file.

## Important Notes

The package currently supports [NeDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nedb) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

`NeDB` is currently useable only inside Electron project.

[MongoDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) is included, but not yet useable at all.
